# How to Cite

This newsletter is protected by a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 License.  The [details of the license are explained here](http://web.archive.org/web/20180402033856/http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).

You are welcome to share, clip and reblog excerpts and you must give credit where credit is due. This applies to anything appearing here–images, blog posts, comments, even tweets. If you’d like to reblog essays in their entirety, please reach out to me for permission first (Note: I will almost always allow it).

I often share material created by others. If you discover and would like to clip/share material that was created by someone else, a simple “hat tip” (or “H/T”) to either me or this blog will suffice, but **please make sure to reach out to the original owner to find out what permissions you might need to share their work.** And, in all things, **acknowledge the original creator** or author in your clip, excerpt, or share.

If you are using material found here in a scholarly work, refer to your favorite citation guide. Almost all of them have instructions for how to cite blogs and websites. To help you along, I’ve posted a few examples below:

[**From CHICAGO/Turabian:**](http://web.archive.org/web/20180402033856/http://dh.jmjafrx.com/citation/www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html/)

Blog posts and comments are usually left out of the bibliography but you should “cite in running text (“In a comment posted to *The Becker-Posner Blog* on February 23, 2010, . . .”)” or more formally in a note:

1. Jessica Marie Johnson, Month Day, Year of Post (H:MM p.m.), comment on Jessica Marie Johnson, “Post Title,” *Kitchen Table History*, Month Day, Year of Post, URL.

2. Jessica Marie Johnson, “Post Title,” *Kitchen Table History*, Month Day, Year of Post, URL.

3. Johnson, comment on Johnson, “Post Title.” *Kitchen Table History*

In a bibliography:

Johnson, Jessica Marie, *Kitchen Table History*. *[https://jmjafrx.substack.com/](https://jmjafrx.substack.com/)*.

 

**MLA FORMAT**

Johnson, Jessica Marie, “Title of individual blog entry.” *Blood+Sweat+Sinew*. DD MM YYYY. Web. Date accessed (URL).  



**APA FORMAT**

Blood+Sweat+Sinew. (YYYY, MM DD). Title of Post [Blog post]. URL.
